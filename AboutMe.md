```python answer = random.randint(1, 8192)
guess = random.randint(1, 8192)
counter = 1
while not answer == guess:
  counter = counter + 1
  print(counter)
  if guess != answer:
    guess = random.randint(1, 8192)
print(counter)
print('Lucky!')
```
This is a little bit of code I made to see how accurate the odds of a 1 in 8192 chance is, turns out it wasn't too far off.
